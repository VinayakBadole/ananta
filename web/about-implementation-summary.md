- **Mobile browsers**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Fallback support**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation support

### Testing and Verification

- **Comprehensive test suite** with 20+ test cases
- **Visual verification script** for manual testing
- **Performance monitoring** for animation frame rates
- **Cross-browser testing** structure in place

### Next Steps

The about section is now fully implemented and ready for integration with the rest of the website. The implementation provides:
